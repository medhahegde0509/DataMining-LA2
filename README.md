K-Means Clustering algorithm


  K-means is one of the most popular Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms Used for Solving Classification Problems. K Means segregates the unlabelled data into various groups, called clusters, based on having similar features, common patterns. It is an Iterative algorithm that divides a group of n datasets into k subgroups/clusters based on the similarity and their mean distance from the centroid of that particular subgroup.
